It is defined as the solid angle subtended at the center of a sphere by an area on the sphere's surface that is equal to the square of the sphere's radius.\\n\\nTo visualize this, imagine a sphere with a radius of r. If we take a patch on the surface of the sphere that has an area equal to r^2, the solid angle subtended by this area at the center of the sphere is exactly one steradian.\\n\\nOne steradian is equal to the solid angle that covers the entire surface area of a sphere with a radius of one meter. In other words, a complete sphere has a solid angle of 4Ï€ steradians (which is approximately 12.57 square radians). The steradian is dimensionless, as it is defined based on the ratio of areas.\\n\\nThe steradian is commonly used in various areas of physics, such as optics, radiometry, and astronomy, to measure solid angles and the distribution of light or radiation in three dimensions. It is an essential quantity for understanding concepts like luminous intensity, radiant intensity, and flux density.\\n\\nIn summary, the steradian is a unit of solid angle, defining the angular extent of a region on the surface of a sphere.
